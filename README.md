<hr>

CodeNest Learning is a coaching website designed to provide users with access to a variety of courses. Users can browse through the available courses and if they find a course they are interested in, they can use the provided contact form to get in touch. The contact form allows users to send their name, email, and additional details or messages.

In addition to browsing courses and contacting the site administrator, users can also apply for online admission directly through the website. The online admission form is comprehensive, collecting information such as full name, email, address, the course they wish to enroll in, and their preferred mode of learning (offline or online).

This project is built using React.js for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. Axios is used for handling connections, facilitating smooth communication between the frontend and the backend. The backend of the website is powered by Java Spring Boot.


Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Js
